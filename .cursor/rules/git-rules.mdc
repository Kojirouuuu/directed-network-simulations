## Branch Strategy

### Main Branches

- **main**: Stable branch for production
- **develop**: Primary development branch (default)

### Development Workflow

1. Always open pull requests targeting the `develop` branch.
2. Perform feature testing and integration on `develop`.
3. Merge `develop` into `main` periodically during releases.

### Branch Naming Convention

Use lowercase and kebab-case.

- New features:  
  `feature/<feature-name>`

- Bug fixes:  
  `fix/<issue-name>`

- Refactoring:  
  `refactor/<target>`

- Documentation:  
  `docs/<topic>`

**Examples:**

feature/user-authentication
fix/login-validation-error
refactor/api-response-handling
docs/setup-guide


---

## Commit Message Rules

✅ **Write all commit messages in English.**

### Format

<type>: <short summary>


Keep the summary:

- imperative ("add", not "added")
- under **72 characters**
- concise and descriptive
- no period at the end

---

### Allowed Types

- `feat:` → New feature  
- `fix:` → Bug fix  
- `refactor:` → Code restructuring without behavior change  
- `docs:` → Documentation only  
- `chore:` → Config, build, dependency updates  
- `test:` → Tests added or modified  
- `perf:` → Performance improvements  

---

### Good Examples

feat: add semi-directed EBCM simulation
fix: resolve race condition in parallel execution
refactor: simplify parameter initialization
docs: update installation instructions
chore: upgrade numpy to 2.x


---

### Avoid

❌ Vague commits:

fix: bug
update
changes


❌ Mixed concerns:

feat: add model and fix logging bug


→ Split into multiple commits.

---

### Recommended (Optional but Strongly Encouraged)

For non-trivial commits, include a body:

feat: add adaptive timestep solver

Improve stability when lambda is large by dynamically
adjusting dt during simulation.


Wrap body lines at **72 characters**.
